As developers, Open Source Software (OSS) is foundational to what we do every
day. We all have different reasons for contributing, but the reasons we don’t
are typically universal. Burn out, lack of resources, lack of appreciation, lack
of desire. Naturally, we tend to accomplish a task when the incentive outweighs
the resources needed to accomplish that task. With OSS, the incentive almost
always approaches zero as the project matures.

At the beginning of March I released [React.js Program — “a linear approach to
learning the React.js ecosystem”](http://reactjsprogram.com/). With a sizable
amount of Luck|Blessings|Privilege, React.js Program has established itself as a
[pretty great way to learn React](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/#testimonials)
and to date has over 25,000 students. It’s been an amazing ride thus far and one
that I hope to continue to grow and learn from. However, one thing has been
clear to me since the day I launched — React.js Program would not be possible if
it weren’t for the individuals who sacrificed their time and energy for the sake
of open source.

I’m of the opinion that if you’re profiting off of an open source ecosystem, you
should give back in any way you can. Whether that’s contributing with code,
money, or a simple thank you — it all goes back to increasing incentives for OSS
authors.

With that said, I’ve committed $4,500 over the next three months to have
React.js Program be the main sponsor of [React
Boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate).
[Max](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) and the other
[contributors](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/graphs/contributors)
have done an amazing job with this project and are experimenting with a new,
[financially incentivized](https://opencollective.com/react-boilerplate)
approach to open source. My hope is that this sponsorship will kick off a new
wave of support for open source projects from companies who profit off of OSS
and who also have [MUCH](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
