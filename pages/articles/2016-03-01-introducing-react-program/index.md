It‚Äôs 3:30AM. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been to bed before this time in over a month.
I‚Äôm ok with this, however. I‚Äôve always loved teaching and for the most part I
think people enjoy my teaching as well. I spent two years teaching the people of
Los Angeles about Jesus, so teaching literally anything else seems pretty
simple, since, well, many people don‚Äôt want to listen to a 19 year old talk
about Jesus.

I started teaching technical topics at [DevMountain](http://devmounta.in/) and
shortly after took over all operations of their whole Web program. It was a
blast and it taught me how to teach technical topics quickly and efficiently.
Teaching is essentially the same thing as programming except instead of
programming computers you‚Äôre programming brains. Teaching at DevMountain was
done entirely in person and it was here I also learned how to build curriculum
to supplement teaching. Last March I wanted to see if the ‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù approach
could be taken outside of the context of beginners and carefully turned towards
mid-sr level developers. I launched [React Week](http://www.reactweek.com/) with
this goal in mind and from what I could see, everyone enjoyed it.

Later I started teaching on
[Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/tyler-mcginnis). Teaching short (3‚Äì5
minute) videos is much different than full hour long classes in person. It‚Äôs
like snowboarding and skateboarding. It helps to know one, but it‚Äôs still
entirely different. Luckily the great people at Egghead have the system down and
they‚Äôve graciously shared the tips with their instructors.

Somewhere in all of this I started blogging more and learned to love writing
about technical topics.

At this point I had pretty solid experience in basically every format of
teaching ‚Äî in person, online via recorded videos, and through text via my blog.
Interestingly enough I wouldn‚Äôt say that one medium is more effective over the
other ‚Äî they‚Äôre all just, different. Combine this sort of thinking/experience
with the outcry of JavaScript fatigue in the community and [React.js
Program](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/) was born. The goal is to take my unique
views of teaching through different mediums and combine it into one program.

The whole premise of React.js Program is that the student is going to have three
different learning approaches thrown at them. First via text. Second via a
video. Third via curriculum.

Not only are there different learning mediums, but each medium has different
prerequisite knowledge applied to it. When teaching you have to walk the thin
line of practical and easy to consume. Building projects bring practicality but
they also require a prerequisite knowledge of the other parts of the codebase
(and even if they don‚Äôt, students are convinced they do). Having hyper focused
examples are easy to consume but then students struggle with ‚Äúputting the pieces
together‚Äù. My solution to this was having the text sections be hyper focused and
having the videos be project based. Naturally this means that each text section
can stand by itself (and for the most part can even be read out of order) while
the video examples have a specific order since we‚Äôre building a project
together. Combine this with actual projects students are required to work
through on their own to apply what‚Äôs been taught via text and videos and you can
see why I haven‚Äôt slept in a while üôÉ.

I think there are those times in life when you‚Äôre about to release something
into the world that you‚Äôve been working tirelessly on and are nervous about the
outcome. This is one of those times for me.

I‚Äôm hopeful though.
